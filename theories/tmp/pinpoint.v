(** * Instructive examples of the guard checker.
  The examples listed below aims to explain, from simple to complicated, the inner workings of the guard checker.
  - [add] for how a term is deemed as a "Strict subterm" as the recarg.
  - TODO: one example to show the power of wf_paths compared to naive set representation.
    probably a simple mutual inductive type.
  - [combine_branches_spec] shows how a [tCase] term is given its subterm_specif.

(* Now the head is expanded to its definition. Leading to it are:
  - The 1-st branch in full is [(fun m' => id (nat->nat->nat) add_obf_head m' (S n))].
  - When checking the body of the branch, the tApp [id (nat->nat->nat) add_obf_head m' (S n))],
    the argument [add_obf_head] requests for reduction since its stack is empty.
  - Thus in the last step of tApp, the head is expanded, and we unwrap the tLambdas until it works.
  Note that the tApp is NOT reduced away.
